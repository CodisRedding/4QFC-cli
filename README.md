# MLS Fantasy Team Generator 2022

Processing all possible combinations of 300 +/- players (depending on how you want to filter them) into 15 player (11 + 4 subs) teams takes an ass load of time.
Feel free to fix that if possible.

Once you've genereatd your teams you can manually move them (`./data/teams/{files}`) to the `assets` dir in the MLS Fantasy Web app https://github.com/CodisRedding/mls-fantasy-web 

# Run

`node index.js`
